# Markdown cheatsheet
This document includes any useful markdown commands, code or hacks that I come across

## Spaces in text

Either:

1. Use ```<pre>``` before and after a chunk of text that includes spaces to ensure they are included in the output
2. Use  ```&nbsp;```, ```&ensp;``` or ```&emsp;``` (these differ in the size of the space)
